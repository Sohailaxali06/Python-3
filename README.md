# Python-3

Welcome to my game!

This is a really simple yet fun Rock Paper and Scissors game programmed in Python, you'll be competing with the computer instead of a live player (It's not AI though).

First, it'll ask you to pick either rock, paper, or scissors. Once you enter your choice, the computer will randomly make a choice between these three options and the program will output the results. At the end, it'll ask you to whether play another round or no; if you enter 'yes', it'll restart the game. On the other hand, if you enter 'no', the program will be terminated.
